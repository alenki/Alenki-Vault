Stress Tip #1
	Ancient Japanese technique for stressful situations:
		Find somewhere to sit comfortably and close your eyes. Consciously try to relax all your muscles and turn your focus to the center of your body around your belly button. You can visualize anything you like: a glowing ball, a black circle, a pulse of energy etc. Whatever you want, so long as you focus your mind on that specific spot. By doing this you will be able to calm yourself down. You will be putting yourself in a good state to start tackling the root cause of your stress.
Stress Tip #2
	S.S.T.A Framework:
		Stress managment framework created by Dr. Arthur Nezoo. Stands for Stop, Slow down, Think, Act.
		Stop and slow down by finding something to write on, or even meditate before that, chill.
		You think by writing down your thoughts. What is it that you're stressing about and why are you feeling stressed about it. Write down as much as you can think of. Doing this will allow you to visualize your current situation more clearly, which then makes it much easier for you to come up with solutions to act on. By laying everything down you will have essentially created a mind map, which is a visual representation of the thoughts going on in your mind.
		Studies show, that mind maps make is easier to think critically, solve problems and come up with ideas.
