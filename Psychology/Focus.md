Being in a state of maximum constant focus is called [[Flow]]

A master of focus and flow: [[Miyamoto Musashi]]

While you are studying or focusing on something, you usually lose focus after around 25-30 minutes, you start to lose concentration, which is why you have to take breaks (Using the [[Pomodoro Technique]]).

Do you lose focus while you play games? Or watch movies? Or chat with friends? No! Thats because you are having fun, so analogically the more fun a subject is, the more you are going to be focused. Studying with friends is fun, so it happens to be a good strat.

Improve your focus:
	1. Set goals and deadlines
	2. Organize your thoughts. We all have responsibilities, don't overdose yourself, think through them one by one.
	3. Find a quiet place for more focus
	4. Eliminate all distractions
	5. Take breaks ([[Pomodoro Technique]]). Mental breaks are very important. Take days off, just like working out, muscles need rest.
	6. Reward yourself. Life is short and you have to enjoy it!
