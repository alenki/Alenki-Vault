Feynman: [[Feynman]]

While you are studying or focusing on something, you usually lose focus after around 25-30 minutes, you start to lose concentration, which is why you have to take breaks (Using the [[Pomodoro Technique]]).

While trying to learn something, you get stressed out because of wanting to be perfect and you tense up. For example throwing a basketball. So you have to make sure to just take it very easy and not tense up.
