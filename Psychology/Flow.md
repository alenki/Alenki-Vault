Flow is a state of consciousness that makes work feel effortless.
Pure focus on the thing you're currently doing: boxing, playing music, playing basketball.
Many of humanities biggest accomplishments have happened in this state of flow. 
Studies show, that neurophysiological shifts that occur while in flow increase the exact skills that research has shown, are most critical to thriving in the 21st century. Like learning, creativity and productivity.

4 Pillars of flow:
	First Pillar. Blockers.
		We are evolutionary wired for flow. Your body wants to put you in flow state if the conditions are met. But there are blockers, if you want to run a marathon, make sure to not have an injury as that is a blocker.
		The 21st century lifestyle blocks flow.
		Your phone in the morning and at other times is like a dam stopping you, the river, from naturally going forward.
		It is very important to do important and difficult tasks in the morning begore you even touch your phone.
	Second Pillar. Flow proneness.
		Your tendency to access flow.
		We had to make our physiology (out body), conducive to proneness, to maximize out likelihood of accessing a flow state.
		To do this, wake up, and begin your work within 90 seconds of opening your eyes. Your flow proneness is highest first thing in the morning!
		In the first 90 seconds of waking up is before the rest of the world can impose its will upon you. Before it damages you and your brain, and ruins you day.
	Third Pillar. Flow triggers.
		Precognitions that instantly drive us into flow.
		The main flow triggers:
		 - Clear goals
		 -  Immediate feedback
		 - Challenge / Skills balance
	Fourth Pillar. Flow cycle.
		The reason behind the most productive people and how they operate.
		Getting great at persisting through the struggle faze of the flow cycle. Not just focusing for a short time and then distracting yourself with something.
