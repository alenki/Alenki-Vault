Take small break (maybe 5 minutes) after each 25 minutes that you are studying, or focusing.
During the break you have to do 3 things in no order:
	1. Breath. Because alot of times we are fatigued and you have brain fog and you don't have clarity.
	2. Hydrate. When you are dehydrated and you have more water it actually increases your reaction time and thinking speed around 30%
	3. Stand up and move around. As your body moves, your brain grooves.

I have a theory, that the pomodoro technique was just created by someone who thought it through, and it got popular because it worked for most people, because the people average attention span goes for around 25 minutes. But actually, attention span depends on peoples lifestyle, so if I live a life of focus, the pomodoro technique might be too weak for me.
