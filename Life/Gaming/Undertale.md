The first ending which I got was a neutral ending, nearly genocide (where you kill everyone), except I spared like 2-3 monsters. After that I had so much regret that I started a second playthrough to get true pacifist ending (where you spare absolutely everyone, basically have 0 exp). Sources say that after selling your soul to Chara on the first playthrough, the second playthrough true pacifist will have a bit of a different ending, but practically the same. Apparantly someone knows if I had past playthroughs and knows if you killed someone and then reset back to last save to not kill them.

Second playthrough you don't fight Flowey because he said that killing him won't stop him from coming back to each of your saves, so after killing Flowey once you can't get proper endings after that.

Undertale is a really difficult game, though its the funniest game ive ever played, pure comedy. The dialogues are pure gold, very uniquely funny.

Undertale breaks the fourth wall, your first affects your next runs, they will make remarks and will have deja vu moments, someone knows about the resets back to last save and the full resets you  are doing.

!! !! Undertale says that it would take all monsters Soul just to equal 1 human Soul. It says that human Souls are so strong they last even after death. Interesting statement.

Undertale, the music is so creepy, relaxing and atmospheric. Definitely will be nostalgic, its lovely. Note: soundtrack in mushroom room, undyne bossfight soundtrack, game over music.

The ending is extremely dramatic and sad, excpetially when you go through the deep hall at the end, with the sad music and the old monsters saying stuff.
