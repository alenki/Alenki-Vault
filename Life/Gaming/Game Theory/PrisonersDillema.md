Prisoner’s Dilemma is the most widely mentioned game in game theory. The basic premise is how to establish a mutually beneficial strategy between 2 members of a gang that got arrested and face potential imprisonment. The rules are as follows:

1. The players of the game are prisoner A and prisoner B.
2. The players can’t communicate with each other.
3. If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison.
4. If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve 3 years in prison. (and vice-versa)
5. If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge)
