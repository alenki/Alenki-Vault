"He is a man of focus, commitment, and sheer fucking will"
"The man, the myth, the legend"
"Without them (Rules) we live with the animals" -Winston

what im learning from John Wick for now, is to be a man of focus, commitment, and sheer fucking will. If you look at John Wick, who is so cool just because of this focus, you just start to imagine how badass and great you would be with focus, you realize just how important focus is, i mean just look at John Wick, you could see focus in him and how its making him op. Stay focused, aware of your surroundings. Even in a very stressful situation be very focused and chill so you could do the right things. I can see how this could have helped me in many of my life situations during fights, arguments and other stressful situations. + Learn to ride horses, really use your surroundings in a fight + Winston, Charon(black guy) and John Wick are the real sigmas, not some psycho Patrick Bateman

Badass rules of JOHN WICK:
 - If you want change, take it personally. If you want a change, than you change it right away
 - Learn where to be aggressive and where to be patient
 - Not everyone around you is your friend
 - Think, take your time and then reply
 - Be a man of focus, commitment, and sheer fucking will
 - Never kill a man's dog
 - Use your surroundings as a weapon
 - Keep working untill you no longer have to introduce yourself
 - Be prepared
 - If the fight is inevitable you have to punch first
