The science behind the fungus:
	Fungus controls the mind!
	"There's a fungus that infects insects. Get's inside of an ant, for example, travels through its circulatory system to the ants brain, and then floods it with hallucinogens, thus bending the ants mind to its will. The fungus starts to direct the ant's behaviour, telling it where to go, what to do, like a puppeteer with a marlonette. And it gets worse. The fungus needs food to live, so it begins to devour its host from within, replacing the ants flesh with its own, but it doesn't let its victim die. No, it keeps its puppet alive by preventing decomposition."
	"Fungus cannot survive if its hosts internal temperature is over 94 degrees."
