#Life 


Basically note everything, use sticky notes. Summarizing.. Finish the book. Go back to all of the notes, write down to Obsidian.

Use things you are learning from books on the spot. If you're reading a book about conversations then go strike up a conversation right away. If you're reading about business, go start your own business while reading the book.
