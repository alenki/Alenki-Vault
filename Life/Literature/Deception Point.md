Dan Brown - Deception Point. 
'A case study in suspense' - Washington Post.

National Reconnaissance Office, Washington: Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton is summoned by the President of The United States to verify a discovery which NASA claims will change the future of the planet itself.
Milne Ice Shelf, Arctic Circle: teams work feverishly to unearth an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the ice. But, accompanied by charismatic academic Michael Tolland, Rachel soon uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery. They soon find out this is not a discovery that anyone wants to hear.
Fleeing for their lives in an environment as desolate as it is lethal, their only hope for survival is to find out who is behind this masterful ploy. And the truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all...

An apparently miraculous scientific discovery might change the future of the planet if its truth is revealed...

Notes:

The Authors' Note
'The Delta Force, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the Space Frontier Foundation are real organizations. All technologies described in this novel exist.' Which is very interesting and scary at the same time

'A number of comebacks came to mind, but Rachel chose silence.'

'Keeping information from the 
director of the NRO was like keeping Vatican secrets 
from the Pope.'

''Apparently the President hopes you are either im- 
pressed or intimidated/ Pickering eyed her. 'I suggest 
you are neither.' 

Rachel nodded. She was both.'

'Suppose, Rachel, that I told you NASA has just made 
a discovery of such scientific importance . . . such 
earth-shattering significance . . . that it validated every 
dollar Americans have ever spent in space?' 

Rachel could not imagine. 

The President stood up. 'Let's take a walk, shall we?'

My personal note(page 66): 
	'A big thing we learn in the past few pages (10s maybe), is that awareness is super important, especially when you are talking to important, smart people. Awareness is the first step, then come things like sharpness, wit, psychology and stuff

'Soon they will understand, Herney told himself. Soon 
I'll be the hero again.

'Herney burst out laughing. 'Hell no, Dolores! I'm 
gearing up to fight!' 

'She looked doubtful. The media reports had all been 
saying President Herney was throwing the election.'

'As Zach Herney entered the Oval Office, he couldn't 
help but smile at the image of his entire staff crammed 
into the deceptively small chamber.'

'Each time a newcomer 
entered the Oval Office, disorientation set in im- 
mediately. The s)mimetry of the room, the gently 
curving walls, the discreetly disguised doorways in and 
out, all gave visitors the dizzying sense theyd been 
blindfolded and spun around. Often, after a meeting 
in the Ov£d Office, a visiting dignitary would stand up, 
shake hands with the President, and march 
straight into a storage closet. Depending on how the meeting 
had gone, Hemey would either stop the guest in time 
or watch in amusement as the visitor embarrassed him- 
self.'

'Fly. Fight. Forget'

'Finally, Rachel spotted the hazy outline of land. But 
it was not what she had expected. Looming out of the 
ocean before the plane was an enormous snowcapped 
mountain range. 

'Mountains?' Rachel asked, confused. 'There are 
mountains north of Greenland?' 

'Apparently,' the pilot said, sounding equally sur- 
prised.'

'As they passed below 3,000 feet, Rachel stared out at 
the dramatic moonlit terrain beneath them. At the base 
of the mountains, an expansive, snowy plain swept 
wide. The plateau spread gracefully seaward about ten 
miles until it ended abruptly at a sheer cliff of solid ice 
that dropped vertically into the ocean. 

It was then that Rachel saw it. A sight like nothing 
she had ever seen an)rwhere on earth. At first she 
thought the moonlight must be playing tricks on 
her. She squinted down at the snowfields, unable to 
comprehend what she was looking at. The lower the 
plane descended, the clearer the image became. 

What in the name of God?

The plateau beneath them was striped ... as if some- 
one had painted the snow with three huge striations of 
silver paint. The glistening strips ran parallel to the 
coastal cliff. Not until the plane dropped past 500 feet 
did the optical illusion reveal itself. The three silver 
stripes were deep troughs, each one over thirty yards 
wide. The troughs had filled with water and frozen 
into broad, silvery channels that stretched in parallel 
across the plateau. The white berms between them 
were mounded dikes of snow.'

'That's the katabatic wind,' the driver yelled. 'Get 
used to it!' He explained that this area had a permanent 
offshore gale called the katabatic - Greek for flow- 
ing downhill. The relentless wind was apparently the 
flroduct of heavy, cold air 'flowing' down the facial 
face like a raging river downhill. 'This is the only 
place on earth,' the driver added, laughing, 'where hell 
actually freezes over!'

'I do not share the President's enthusiasm for involving 
you in this matter.'

''A Sexton spy behind enemy lines?' 

'Battle lines are not always drawn where you might 
think.''

Personal Note (page 108):
	Sometimes, to understand something, you have to see it, rather than hear about it. There are stuff you won't understand until you see.
	
'Actually, what's so special about 
this meteorite is best seen, not explained.'

'Gabrielle nodded, noncommittal. She'd sensed a look 
of smug satisfaction on Marjorie Tench's face as the 
woman drove off. It made her nervous.'

'The senator, like most politicians, 
had a hierarchy of phone numbers at which his 
contacts could reach him, depending on how important 
they were.'

'When Rachel grasped the simple brilliance of the 
woman's plan, she was impressed. Norah had simply 
aimed the laser beam downward, melting through the 
ice until the beam hit the meteorite. The stone, being 
too dense to be melted by a laser, began absorbing the 
laser's heat, eventually getting warm enough to melt 
the ice around it As the NASA men hoisted the hot 
meteorite, the heated rock, combined with the upward 
pressure, melted the surroimding ice, clearing a path- 
way to raise it to the surface. The melt water 
accumulating over the meteorite simply seeped back 
down around the edges of the stone to refill the shaft.'

'Tolland and the others joined them now. Tolland 
smiled at Rachel. 'She knows a lot about ice, doesn't 
she?' 

Rachel felt oddly happy to see him. 'Yeah, she's 
amazing.''

PAGE 147: The Reveal.

'Should I consult Sexton? She quickly decided against it. 
He was in a meeting. Besides, if she told him about this 
e-mail, she'd have to tell him about the others. She 
decided her informant's offer to meet in public in broad 
daylight must be to make Gabrielle feel safe. After all, 
this person had done nothing but help her for the last 
two weeks. He or she was ==obviously== a friend.'

''I would like to 
ask that you endorse this discovery personally, for the 
record, as my White House intelligence liaison . . . and 
as the daughter of my opponent.' 

There it was. On the table. 

Herney wants me to endorse.'

'Just tell them the truth. How hard is that?'

'Rachel didn't understand what he meant, but it was 
too late to ask. The President threw the switch.

This is Wailee Ming's discovery now!'

'There is no other explanation! He could not believe that NASA and 
Corky Marlinson had somehow missed something this 
incredible, but Ming wasn't complaining.'

'Delta-One stared intently at the image of the solitary 
Wailee Ming, perched precariously on the rim of the 
extraction pit. Nobody was anywhere near him - and 
ice cold water had a way of muffling one's ability to 
scream. 'Give me the controls.' 

'What are you doing?' the soldier on the joystick 
demanded. 

'What we were trained to do,' Delta-One snapped, 
taking over. =='Improvise.'=='

'Drowning, Ming had once read, was the most 
horrific death imaginable.'

PAGE 172: Ming's Death!

'Ming's breathing instinct over- 
came his ability to keep his mouth closed. 

Wailee Ming inhaled. 

The water crashing into his lungs felt like scalding oil 
on his sensitive pulmonary tissue. He felt like he was 
burning from the inside out. Cruelly, water does not kill 
immediately. Ming spent seven horrifying seconds in- 
haling in the icy water, each breath more painful than 
the last, each inhalation offering none of what his body 
so desperately craved. 

Finally, as Ming slid downward into the icy darkness, 
he felt himself going unconscious. He welcomed the 
escape. All around him in the water Ming saw tiny 
glowing specks of light. It was the most beautiful thing 
he had ever seen.'

'Forget the ghosts, he willed himself. They often 
haunted him at times like these, when he was tired or 
alone - times of personal triumph or celebration. She 
should be with you right now, the voice whispered. Alone 
in the darkness, he felt himself reeling backward into 
oblivion.'

'Literally thousands of undiscovered species, he gushed, 
live in these depths! We’ve barely scratched the surface! There 
are mysteries down here that none of us can imagine!'

'The answer was 
always the same. Incurable. 

I will not accept that!' - Tolland

'Only seven months had passed when Michael 
Tolland found himself sitting beside his dying wife in a 
stark hospital ward. He no longer recognized her face. 
The savageness of the cancer was rivaled only by the 
brutality of the chemotherapy. She was left a ravaged 
skeleton. The final hours were the hardest.'

'Yom have a choice to make, he finally realized. Work or 
die.' (Tolland)

'As Rachel approached the dramatic press area, she 
imagined the impending announcement and couldn't 
help but wonder if her father really deserved the 
presidential steamroller that was about to blindside 
him, crushing his campaign in a single blow. 

The answer, of course, was yes. 

Whenever Rachel Sexton felt any soft spot for her 
father, all she had to do was remember her mother.'

'Yes, she decided. Senator Sexton was about to get exactly 
what he deserved.'

'Tolland picked up a shard of ice off the glacial floor 
and tossed it into the water. The water phosphoresced at 
the point of impact, glowing with a sudden green splash. 

'Mike,' Corky said, looking uneasy, 'please tell me 
you know what that is.' 

Tolland frowned. 'I know exactly what this is. My 
question is, what the hell is it doing here?''

'Tolland said, 'the meteorite was buried in 
glacial ice - freshwater from snowfalls. The water in 
that hole is glacial melt and has been frozen for three 
centuries. How could ocean creatures get in there?''

'Bio- 
luminescent plankton in the extraction shaft. What does it 
mean?'

'I'm sorry, IDr Marlinson,' Rachel said, 'as someone 
who analyzes data for a living, I have to disagree. Any 
tiny flaw in the data NASA presents tonight has the 
potential to cast doubt over the credibility of the entire 
discovery. Including the authenticity of the fossils.'

'True. Space science would die in a heartbeat. Instead 
of spending money to study our universe, private space 
companies would strip-mine asteroids, build tourist 
hotels in space, offer commercial satellite launch 
services. Why would private companies bother study- 
ing the origins of our universe when it would cost them 
billions and show no financial return?'

'True. Space science would die in a heartbeat. Instead

companies would strip-mine asteroids, build tourist 
hotels in space, offer commercial satellite launch 
services. Why would private companies bother study- 
ing the origins of our universe when it would cost them 
billions and show no financial return?'

'It's a negative for the country. It implicates dozens of 
private companies, many of which are made up 
of honest people. It besmirches the office of the U.S. 
Senate and is bad for the country's morale. Dishonest 
politicians hurt all politicians. Americans need to trust 
their leaders. This would be an ugly investigation and 
would most likely send a U.S. senator and numerous 
prominent aerospace executives to jail.'

'But what Norah had never expected to see was the 
hazy grayish outline of a humanoid form floating half- 
way down the shaft. Her blood turned to ice. 'Oh God 
. . . there's a body in the extraction pit.''

'This strategy, 
known in Washington as the 'high-low,' was stolen 
from the art of militaiy warfare. Force the enemy to battle 
on two fronts. When a candidate possessed a piece 
of negative information about his opponent, he often 
waited until he had a second piece and went public 
with both simultaneously. A double-edged attack was 
always more effective than a single shot, particularly 
when the dual attack incorporated separate aspects of 
his campaign - the first against his politics, the second 
against his character. Rebuttal of a political attack took 
logic, while rebuttal of a character attack took passion; 
disputing both simultaneously was an almost impossible balancing act.'

'Just shadows,' Delta-One said, turning from the cliff. 
'Let's get back to base.'

'It's the Wal-Marting of space/ the Texan said'

Personal Note. Page 330.
	Doesn't matter how much time you wasted on getting something, everything and all progress can be destroyed in the matter of seconds. Luck wins.

'All of the NASA inertia he had so care- 
fuUy built up over the last months had not only come 
to a screeching halt, but it had become an anchor 
around his neck. He looked like a fool. He'd been 
brazenly played by the White House. He was already 
dreading all the cartoons in tomorrow's paper. His 
name would be the punch line to every joke in the 
country. Obviously, there would be no more quiet SFF 
campaign funding. Everything had changed. All of the 
men who had been in his apartment had just seen their 
dreams go down the toilet. The privatization of space 
had just struck a brick wall.'

'For centuries we've been looking for proof of life in the heavens. Now we find it in 
the same fucking year as my election? This wasn't 
propitious, this was goddamned clairvoyant. Every 
apartment window, for as far as Sexton could see, had a 
television on. Sexton wondered where Gabrielle Ashe 
was tonight. This was all her fault. She'd fed him NASA 
failure after NASA failure.'

'They had no time for 
personal reflection. There would be time for that after 
the work was done.' - Exactly what I thought.

'Remove all assumptions, she told herself, 
forcing herself to reorganize her thoughts. Reestablish 
the chain of substantiation. It was an old NRO trick. 
Rebuilding a proof from scratch was a process known 
as a 'null start' - something all data analysts practiced 
when the pieces didn't quite fit. 

Reassemble the proof. 

She began pacing again. 

Does this stone represent proof of extraterrestrial life? 

Proof, she knew, was a conclusion built on a pyramid 
of facts, a broad base of accepted information on which 
more specific assertions were made. 

Remove all the base assumptions. Start again.'

'They made contact with a subm2uine and are now 
en route to Washington.' - Okay so it's Tonah

'NASA 
lied about PODS. The only question was how Sexton 
could prove it.' - Funny reference to math.

'And redeem herself she would. 
Whatever it took.'

'Immediately upon hanging up, Marjorie Tench phoned 
NASA Administrator Ekstrom. Her voice was tight as 
she relayed the bad news. 

'Pickering could be a problem.'' - Oh, it seems it's Tench and Dekstorm

'What a difference a day makes, the President thought. In 
politics, your world can change in an instant. 

By dawn he would realize just how true those words 
could be.'

Personal Note. Page 390.
	Watch Gabriel destroy Chinis with this technique (to make someone confess a lie, accuse him of a bigger one)
	Also, confidence is really important, if she didn't have that, he obviously wouldn't have confessed.

'Gabrielle was stunned. 'The administrator of NASA?' 

'Harper gave a grim nod. 'He's the one who forced 
me to lie in that press conference.''

'Rolls-Royce Allison engine and twin semirigid blades 
were 'silent running,' which essentially meant targets 
on the ground could not hear the chopper until it 
was directly over them. And because the aircraft was 
capable of flying blind without lights and was painted 
flat black with no reflective tail numbers, it was 
essentially invisible unless the target had radar. 

Silent black helicopters.'

'Wrong again. But the military loved the diversion.'

Personal Note. Page 424.
	Nasa is very sus. I didn't think this through deeply, but Nasa could be the controlling power of the world (The men in black suits). Or this could be a hoax for other countries to think USA has big hidden weapons.

'Rachel smiled softly. 'Well, as my mom used to say, 
sooner or later we've all got to let go of our past.''

'Nobody was supposed to die . . . except the Canadian.' lol

'The insertion, completed months ago, had come off 
without a hitch. Once the anomaly was in place, all that 
remained was to wait for the Polar Orbiting Density 
Scanner (PODS) satellite to launch. PODS was slated to 
scan enormous sections of the Arctic Circle, and sooner 
or later the anomaly software onboard would detect the 
meteorite and give NASA a major find.'

'Tolland tossed the bloody fish overboard and it fell 
thirty feet. The instant it hit the water, six or seven 
sharks darted in a tumbling ferocious brawl, their rows 
of silvery teeth gnashed wildly at the bloody fish. In an 
instant, the fish was gone. 

Aghast, Rachel turned and stared at Tolland, who 
was already holding another fish. Same kind. Same 
size. 

'This time, no blood,' Tolland said. Without cutting 
the fish, he threw it in the water. The fish splashed 
down, but nothing happened. The hammerheads 
seemed not to notice. The bait carried away on the 
current, having drawn no interest whatsoever. 

'They attack only on sense of smell,' Tolland said, 
leading them away from the railing. 'In fact, you could 
swim out here in total safety - provided you didn't 
have any open wounds.''

'After Katherine died, 
the senator squandered the vast majority of her legacy on bad 
investments, personal comforts, and buying himself what 
appears to be certain victory in the primaries. As of six 
months ago, your candidate was broke.'

''Bathynomous giganteus . . .' Tolland read aloud as the 
text appeared. The photograph loaded. A full-color 
close-up.'

'Senator Sexton had embraced the 'digital office' to 
maniacal proportions, eschewing the overflow of file 
cabinets for the compact, searchable simplicity of his 
personal computer, into which he fed enormous 
amounts of information - digitized meeting notes, 
scanned articles, speeches, brain storms. Sexton's computer was his sacred ground, and he kept his office 
locked at all times to protect it. He even refused to 
connect to the Internet for fear of hackers infiltrating 
his sacred digital vault.
  
A year ago Gabrielle would never have believed 
any politician would be stupid enough to store copies 
of self-incriminating documents, but Washinton 
had taught her a lot. ==Information is power==.'

'was to keep actual proof of those donations - 
letters, bank records, receipts, logs - all hidden away 
in a safe place.'

'Tolland reacted on instinct, aiming the only weapon 
he had. 

The flare gun in his hand hissed when he pulled the 
trigger'

'Corky had not been able to reach them. He'd 
been forced to make a snap decision. 

Divide and conquer.' - He left the other 2 as a distraction

'Corky slumped. Divide and conquer. Apparently he 
was not the only one with that bright idea tonight.'

'Tell the helicopter to back off that speedboat. If they 
kill my friend, you die.'

'The soldier winced in pain as he lifted his communi- 
cation device to his lips. He looked directly at Tolland 
as he pressed the button and spoke. 'Delta-Three here. 
I'm fine. Destroy the departing vessel.'' - Chad

'Leave things exactly as you found them.'

'Never underestimate the ego of a politician.'

'Onboard the Goya, Michael Tolland did not see his 
Crestliner Phantom 2100 erupt in flames and tumble 
through the air in a cartwheel of fire and smoke. 

But he heard the explosion.'

'Tolland had 
arched as if preparing to ram the rod through Delta- 
Three's throat. But as he did, he seemed to hesitate, as 
if his own morality were holding him back. With brutal 
frustration and fury, Tolland yanked the rod away and 
drove his boot down on Delta-Three's tattered foot.'

'As Delta-Two approached the submersible, he ap- 
preciated the rare luxury of being able to watch his own 
back'

'They will not get away with this. Whoever it is, the truth 
will be told.'

'What in the name of God?'

'Rachel held one of the Delta 
Force's machine guns on him and stared up at the 
chopper as if daring them to attack. 

Delta-One felt momentarily disoriented, unable to 
fathom how this possibly could have happened. The 
Delta Force's errors on the ice shelf earlier had been a 
rare but explainable occurrence. This, however, was 
unimaginable.'

'But tonight 
his shame was magnified by the presence of another 
individual riding with him inside the chopper, a person 
whose presence here was highly unconventional. 

The controller.'

page 509

''You're too late' she said. 'We're not the only ones 
who know.''

''Are you ready to take that chance?' Rachel fired 
back. 'I couldn't get through to William Pickering 
earlier, so I got spooked and took out some insurance.''

Personal Note. Page 512.
	I absolutely love what just happened. Absolutely genius from Rachel. This was so satisfying. I just love this. Absolutely destroyed them.

'a tiny LED meter 
indicated that a SATCOM data signal was being trans- 
mitted from the Goya. But how? Nobody left the deck! 
Before Delta-One could engage the jammer, the con- 
nection from the Goya terminated on its own accord. 

Inside the hydrolab, the fax machine beeped con- 
tentedly. 

CARRIER FOUND . . . FAX SENT'

'Kill or be killed. Rachel had discovered a part of herself 
she never knew existed. Survival mode - a savage 
fortitude fueled by fear.'

Personal Note. Page 514.
	Bruh!!! I definitely expected it to be someone very unexpected, so I tried to be smart and already predicted who it was (Sexton, president), but DAMN. Dan Brown fools me again

'The data is gone. You've lost. Leave the area, or this 
man dies.''

'Shock, betrayal, confusion, rage. 

All understandable, he thought. There is so much she does 
not understand.'

''Rachel,' Pickering said. 'We can still work this out. 
There's a lot I need to explain.''

'Pickering sighed. 'NASA, for all its flaws, must remain 
a government entity.' Certainly she can understand the 
dangers. Privatization would send NASA's best minds 
and ideas flooding into the private sector. The brain 
trust would dissolve. The military would lose access. 
Private space companies looking to raise capital would 
start selling NASA patents and ideas to the highest 
bidders worldwide! 

Rachel's voice was tremulous. 'You faked the 
meteorite and killed innocent people... in the name of 
national security?' 

'It was never supposed to happen like this/ Pickering 
said. 'The plan was to save an important government 
agency. Killing was not part of it.''

'Pickering, on the other hand, had 
an unlimited budget.'

'Delta-One almost had to laugh at the hollowness of the 
illusion.'

Personal Note. Page 518.
	How is it Pickering if not too long ago the controller said Pickering will be a problem?

'In a matter of minutes, he knew, this will all be over.'

'Marjorie Tench is dead.' - DAMN

'Sex scandals and bribery 
were cancers in Washington, and waving another one 
in front of the public only added to their distrust of 
government. 

Cynicism is killing this country. 

Although Herney knew he could destroy Sexton with 
scandal, the cost would be besmirching the dignity of 
the U.S. Senate, something Herney refused to do. 

No more negatives. Herney would beat Senator Sexton 
on the issues.'

''He's very upset.' 

HE'S upset? Hemey could feel his temper fra)dng 
around the edges. As he stalked off to take Ekstrom's 
call, the President wondered what the hell else could 
possibly go wrong tonight.' - Lol, just imagine what could.

'Pickering had not even tried to bring Herney or 
Ekstrom into the fold because both were far too idealistic 
to have agreed to any deceit, regardless of its potential 
to save the presidency or space agency. Administrator 
Ekstrom's only crime had been persuading the PODS 
mission supervisor to lie about the anomaly software, 
a move Ekstrom no doubt regretted the moment he 
readized how scrutinized this particular meteorite^ would 
become.'

'If Tench had used the photos and bribery data I gave her, 
none of this would have happened!' - Bruh shut up

'The 
best defense is a good offense. At least that's what Yolanda 
Cole always said.'

'Extend the bond of trust. It's all about trust.'

'He motioned to his leather chair the position of power.'

'Forget your instincts. You were wrong. 

As Sexton dried his face, he threw his head back and 
took a, deep breath. Relax, he told himself. Don't get 
punchy. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply again, 
feeling better.'

'Meteorite is fake. Here's proof 

NASA/White House trying to kill me. Help! - RS'

'The meteorite is a fake? NASA and the White House are 
trying to kill her?'

'Shockingly, 
the accompanying description said the rock was the 
product of oceanic volcanism. A rock from the ocean? 
Sexton wondered. But NASA said chondrules form only in 
space!'

'The NASA meteorite is a fake!'

'More proof? How 
much more could there be? This is plenty!'

'Pickering wants me to be quiet about this?'

''They won't kill Rachel,' Sexton declared. Even 
if something went wrong, Sexton knew losing his 
daughter to the enemy would only make him more 
powerful still. Either way he would win. Acceptable 
risk.'

'Of course if that fails, Rachel thought, Pickering could 
just fly by and send a Hellfire missile through the window 
and blow up the fax machine. Something told her this 
would not be necessary.'

'Life is mocking me.'

'Mike, you don't have to make it alone. You'll find another 
love.'

''You're a survivor,' her voice whispered. 'Promise me 
you'll find another love.' 

'I'll never want another,' Tolland had told her.'

''Sometimes' he said, 'circumstances raise impossible 
decisions''

'War involves casualties,' Pickering said, his voice 
firmer now. Ask Diana Pickering, or any of those who die 
every year defending this nation. 'You of all people should 
understand that, Rachel.' His eyes focused in on her. 
'lactura paucourm serva multos.'

'Sacrifice the few to save the many.'

'With the gun firmly on her back, Delta-One marched 
her over to an aluminum set of portable stairs that led 
up to the top of the Triton sub from behind. 'Climb up 
and stand on top of the sub.' 

Rachel looked frightened and confused.'

''Don't do this' Gabrielle begged the senator as he 
finished at the copy machine. 'You're risking your 
daughter's life!' 

Sexton blocked out her voice, moving back to his 
desk now with ten identical stacks of photocopies. 
Each stack contained copies of the pages Rachel had 
faxed him, including her handwritten note claiming the 
meteorite was a fake and accusing NASA and the White 
House of trying to kill her.'

'Gabrielle was still pleading for Rachel's safety, 
but Sexton heard only silence. As he assembled the 
envelopes, he was in his own private world. Every 
political career has a defining moment. This is mine.'

''Don't you see you've already won?' Gabrielle 
demanded. 'There's no way Zach Herney and NASA 
will survive this scandal. No matter who makes it public! 
No matter when it comes out! Wait until you know 
Rachel is safe. Wait until you talk to Pickering!' 

Sexton was clearly no longer listening to her.'

'Gabrielle could not believe the thought had even 
crossed his mind, much less his lips. Disgusted, she 
reached for the phone. 'I'm calling the White — ' 

Sexton spun and slapped her hard across the face. 

Gabrielle staggered back, feeling her lip split open.'

'Then, for the first time since she 
had come to Washington, Gabrielle Ashe broke down 
and cried.'

'Falling through the ice. Sliding underwater. 

Breathless. Unable to lift herself. Sinking. 

Her mother calling for her. 'Rachel! Rachel!''

'The fear in her voice 
made him feel powerless. For an instant he was back 
in a cold hospital, watching the woman he loved die 
and knowing there was nothing he could do. Hover- 
ing underwater in front of the sinking sub, Tolland 
told himself he could not endure this again. You're a 
survivor, Celia had told him, but Tolland did not want 
to survive alone . . . not again.'

'Nothing brings out the vultures like the smell of death, 
Sexton thought.'

'If information was power, then Sexton was carrying a nuclear warhead.'

'A perfect day to become the most powerful man in the world.'

Personal Note. Page 572.
	DAMN.

'Rachel was standing there. 'We tried to stop you,' she 
said. 'We gave you every chance.' A woman stood 
beside her. 

Sexton was trembling as his eyes moved to the 
woman at Rachel's side. She was the reporter in 
the cashmere coat and mohair beret - the woman who 
had knocked over his envelopes. Sexton saw her face, 
and his blood turned to ice. 

Gabrielle's dark eyes seemed to bore right through 
him as she reached down and opened her coat to reveal 
a stack of white envelopes tucked neatly beneath her 
arm.'

'Gabrielle saw true kindness in his 
gaze, an honor and dignity she would not soon forget.'

'The damage to the country could have been worse, she told 
herself. Much worse.'

'Give the 
President a chance to announce his meteorite mistake, or the
