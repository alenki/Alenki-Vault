#Life 

Since we sleep laying down, our body is already conditioned to feel sleepy lying down. So you definetly have to read or work sitting upright.
When we read lying down 2 things can happen:
	1. We get drowsy, yawn and then pass out after a couple of pages.
	2. We reprogram our brain that laying down is actually reading time, which make is harder to go to sleep.
