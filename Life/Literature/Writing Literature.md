#Life 


- "It's the most powerful weapon you can possibly provide someone with and I mean I know lots of people who have been staggeringly successful and watched them throughout my life. I mean, those people, you don't want to have an argument with them. They'll just slash you into pieces and then not in the malevolent way. It's like if you're gonna make your point you better have your points organized, because otherwise, you're gonna look like and be like an absolute idiot, you are not gonna get anywhere and if you can formulate your arguments coherently and make a presentation, if you can speak to people, if you can lay out a proposal, god, people will give you money, they give you opportunities, you have influence.
