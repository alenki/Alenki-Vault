ITMO is my dream university, its probably the best university in Russia for programming, but its extremely hard to get the budget positions.

Three categories of people get the budget positions. The number one positions can even not do the EGE, they have 100% garrantee to get in. The number two positions are promised to get in. The number threes your more likely to get in than to not:
1. The winners of VSOSH and MOSH and some others
2. The prizers of VSOSH and MOSH and some others
3. 110 points in informatics, 90+ in russian and prof maths
