Sleep is important. Thee are 3 stages of sleep:
	1. Deep sleep - where you save all of the information that you have consumed throughout the day.
	2. Light sleep - where you clean up all of the information that you have saved to make room for new information.
	3. Rem sleep - where you understand your saved information. This is where some people get new innovative ideas.

Deep sleep is more in the beginning of sleep , so don't stay up late. 
Light sleep is more at the end of sleep, so don't wake up way too early.

It is extremely important to sleep on a regular bases, at the same time each day. Even if you slept too late it would still be better to wake up at the same time you usually do.
It is also very useful to get sunlight into your eye's in the morning.
Hydration is very important in the morning.

**Temperature.**
At night your temperature cools down to make you sleepy. During sleep, you start heating up untill you reach a point that makes you naturally wake up. This is why its easier to sleep in a room that's way too cold, than way too hot.
_Taking a worm shower before sleep._
When warm water hits the skin, your body automatically tries to cool off hence making you sleepy. Which makes warm showers good to do before bed.
_Cold showers_ do the opposite, that's why people have cold showers in the morning to wake themselves up.
