#Self 

Fill your brain in the afternoons with books, learning and socialization.
Empty your brain before bed with journaling, planning and meditation.
Use your brain in the morning with creation, output, and focus.
These actions have to be timed, a routine.

You need 3 activities to pursue your goals full force.
	1. One that fills your mind - you need education, ideas, and novel resources you can apply toward your goals. This leads to intrinsic motivation
	2. One that empties your mind - you don’t want to be trapped in a chaotic bubble of thoughts and useful ideas. That’s exactly how you make zero progress. Write things down.
	3. One that uses your mind - you need a vessel to focus your efforts. With your ideas and the clarity to execute, build your future.
