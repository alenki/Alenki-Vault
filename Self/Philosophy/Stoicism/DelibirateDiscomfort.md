#Self 

Practice delibirate discomfort. This practice is to constantly test ourselfes by making life routinely uncomfortable in some way to harden ourselves for the day we may need to live it for real.

- Strength of will
- Endurance
- Resillience

Stoic philosophy says, just because you can afford a nice meal everytime, doesn’t mean you should do so. In fact you ay feel better if you skip a few meals from time to time, just to experience hunger. It builds perseverence and grit, but more importantly, it demolishes the need for comfort. Once you overcome the need for comfort, life will become much easier because setting your goals and sticking to them will be far easier. The best time to routinely practice voluntary discomfort is in the morning. One methid of voluntary discomfort is starting each morning with a cold shower. Implementing cold showers into your daily routine can not only build mental and physical endurance, but also promote fat loss, reduce depression, lower stress and improve circulation.

- Avoid social media so you could do more productive work like reading or journaling. (In my case instead of journaling it could be learning philosophy or Stoicism, learning other things, writing interesting things that happen in my life, that I would like to remember)
- Also you can sleep on the floor. The more you seek the uncomfortable, the more you’ll be comfortable.
