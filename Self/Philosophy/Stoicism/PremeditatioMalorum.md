Practice Premeditatio Malorum (probably in the morning)(negative visualization). The idea is to stay prepared for the future. It’s better to be prepared, than unprepared. Maybe if you’re going to school, imagine the worst cast scenario, for example getting a 2 in Russian, so when you get it, you atleast are mentally prepared, and you take it like you knew it was going to happen. Same thing with a date or something, expect the worst. (Don’t know about this idea, it seems like it could have bad effects, maybe its better to just learn to take it calmly when something happens?) When you prepare for the worst in the morning, you are in a better place to deal with disaster if and when it does arise during the day.

What could go wrong?

How would you handle?
