Good thinking begins with clear thinking, and clear thinking begins by turning your thoughts into unambiguous logical statements.

Clear logic -> Clear thoughts -> Intentional action -> Clear feedback -> Improved understanding of the world -> Better ability to solve problems.

I've found out about a thing that sounds lame and feels like something that won't do anything. But trust me, when you think about it, you see its possibilities. It really could help a lot. It is thinking step by step:

                                                         Thought
                                                             |
                                    ---- Internal Action ----
                                  |                         |
                               True                      False
                                  |                         |
                                  ---------Feedback----------
                                                            |
                            Better understanding of the world
                                                            |
         Ability to think clearly and quickly solve problems

Thought: If I turn the tap on, water will come out, and I will be able to drink and hydrate myself. 
Then I do this process, and depending on the feedback, if it was true or not. I could get a better understanding of how the world works.

Clear logical thought:
"If I publish a how-to video with a philosopher in the title, then it will get over 100 000 views"
That clear thought leads to clear action. I will write that video and publish it.
The video we published will give us clear feedback, and wether it was true or false, we will get a better understanding of the world. And my improving my understanding of the world, I'll be better equipped to solve my problem of becoming a successful youtuber. 


Maybe I need to implement this, it would really help a lot to think clearly like that: If I go and get a cold shower, it will help me a lot. This leads to clear action, without thinking about it for any more seconds, because all other thoughts will be about how I don't want to do the thing. If you see something that will help you, go do it without any thinking. Only clear, logical thoughts.
