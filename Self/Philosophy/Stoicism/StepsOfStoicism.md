From this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8wV2x0iauM:
	Step 1. Responsibility
		In this world you are responsible for the problems you didn't create.
		If you help yourself, people are more likely to help you. If your car breaks down on the highway and you stand there waving for help, nobody will stop. But if you begin to push your own car, other drivers will get out and push with you.
	Step 2. Accept what you cannot control
		If something is completely out of your control, then there is no need to waste your energy by getting upset or frustrated. Use your energy wisely. If your flight is cancelled, getting angry because of it will never change the outcome of the situation.
		Stoicism isn't about not having emotions but learning how to control them.
		Don't waste your energy on any useless thoughts.
	Step 3. Realising that bad feelings can be used for good.
		Anger, sadness and heartbreak can help you wake up earlier, work harder, train harder and be more productive than you ever though was possible.
		Bad feelings can be the ultimate motivator and help you on your way to achieving all your goals, no matter what they are.
		A stoic always gets his work done, no matter how he feels. Your feelings should not have control over your actions.

		"If you are ill disciplined, you are a slave to your moods"
	Step 4. There is no past, there is no future. There is only the present.
		What you want is not correlated to what you get. What you get is only correlated to what you do. It doesn't matter if you want to be fit and healthy if you never work out and eat unhealthy. Your habits create who you are. And all your habits take place in the present.
	Step 5. Practice (Most important)
		No video can do the hard work for you. You are the one who has to practice daily no matter what. Take control over your life and really think about these steps in detail.
		If you ever catch yourself overly emotional, you can always reread the info or rewatch the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8wV2x0iauM (How to become a STOIC with an IRON MIND)
