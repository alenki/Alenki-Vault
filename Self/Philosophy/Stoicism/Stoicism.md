#Self 

You have a certain type of person who seems to be unfazed by everything. A person everyone wishes they could be. A person who will never react or get emotional. A person who could experience the greatest joy or suffer the most horrible tragedy and you would never know the difference. This is the person a child wants as a father. A mother wants as a son(don't know about this one). And a woman wants as her husband. No matter what this person feels, he will always do what needs to be done. And therefore get what we wants. This person is a Stoic.

The stoics in ancient Greece were renowned for achieving inner peace by accepting the things they cannot change, by putting their energy toward their actions. This way, a Stoic is not affected by the world around him, but he is the one who affects the world.

Stoicism isn't about not having emotions but learning how to control them.

Thousands of years ago the stoics discovered a transformative approach to life that can empower us even in todays complex world. By embracing principles such as [[CultivatingVirtue]], facing adversity head on and practicing detachment, the stoics laid the foundation for an undefeatable character.
The path to happiness lies in living a life of reason, discipline and self control.

Tackle the most important task first.

Concentrate every minute like a Roman - like a man - on doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice.

Marcus Aurelius:

- Tackled his most difficult tasks first.
- Did not procrastinate or put things off
- Never neglected hard work or avoided his most unpleasant duties.
- He had a job to do, and he never complained about it to himself or to anyone else.

About the most difficult and important task: You go about your day knowing you have done it and the rest of your day will be easy in comparison. By completing the most important task on your to do list before anything else, you get both momentum and a sense of accomplishment.

A Stoic is good and all that. But I’ve never seen an actual one. Not on tv, not anime, books and real life. It cannot be that no ruler was a Stoic. Could it be media? Could they be hiding it?

Good media for Stoicism and psychology:
	Monogatari
	Berserk
	Dark Souls
	Sekiro
	John Wick
