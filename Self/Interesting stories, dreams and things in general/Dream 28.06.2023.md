#Self 

I had a dream where I had a black suitcase in my hand, that was incredibly dangerous that creepy people in black suits where trying basically to get me, because of that suitcase. I ran and ran around looking for a place to hide, while these men where chasing me, I came upon 3 pathways, I chose the right one and found a big field of grass, at the end of which was a house entrance, which I remember detailedly at the next night. I look and look, even try some places, but the grass is just way too short. I find a place, but I look behind me and the people have already seen me, so they would know where I hid it. Then I run again away and find another big grass field which is probably better, I look behind me, no people. And there goes the end of the dream...
