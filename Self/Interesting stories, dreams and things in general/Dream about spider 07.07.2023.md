#Self 

I "woke" up, saw the chair in front of me, the same one that is in front of me in real life. Everything is exactly as it was when I went to sleep, except that there is a massive yellow spider with brown regions on it sitting upside down on the head of my chair. I get my tapochka and hit it, after that I look and it is gone.
