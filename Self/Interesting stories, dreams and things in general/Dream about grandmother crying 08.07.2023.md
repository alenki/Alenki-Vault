Me and the whole family is in a weird place. I don't see anyone except my grandma, and she is crying really hard. She says that we have done something that made god stop the incoming war. Which is supposed to be a very massive war. But she is not crying of happiness. She is saying, that if we've done this to stop the war, then what calamity is going to come next?
