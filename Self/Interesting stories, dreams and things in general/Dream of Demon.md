#Self 

I saw my Osetinskoe 125 house in Nalchik. It was incredibly dark, there was one more room on the right of the main window. I was checking the house, each room, looking for something. Then at the corner of my eye I saw a grandmother sitting in a chair in Dalias room. Then I go and start hitting that grandmother, turns out to be a disgusting demon, and I beat the hell out of it.
After this dream my life changed for the better and I stopped having nightmares and being scared.
