#Self #BlackArmy 


In the end times there will be a black army of Islam, that will have Imam Mehdi, that will be the strongest army of all, it will be stronger than anything that will come in its way. Now, for there to be such an army, weapons and bombs are not enough. My theory, is the power to control to world or something like that. Maybe this is the power you need. To find out, first, figure out if it is halal. Then you have to learn to do it. Then you have to find out the physics behind it, basically how it works., then teach it to the right people and make an army. Now if you learn to use it, making an army will be very easy. You show people your rented power, and people will of course join you!

Black Army Training - [[BlackArmyTraining]]

The small community that is controlled by the shaitan. I will call them the [[Army of Shaitan]].

I, we, are the army of Allah (swt), we are smarter, stronger, have a smarter, greater and mentally stronger leader, and we are the army of the one and all mighty Allah, for the cause of Allah, who is much greater than anything else that exists.
We posses more powerful and greater secrets, and I will try to get as much people from the Army of Shaitan (blinded people), to join the army of Allah, the true path, the one and only way.
Our secrets will be greater and more truthful than any other, because we are with Allah.
This is no Taliban, we don't just attack random buildings, even if of bad countries, we don't work like that. We work for the cause of Allah, rules of Quran without extremism.

Greatest strength of an army is motivation and inspiration How do you motivate a man with nothing to lose? No family. No friends. No Lover. Well, probably, in my army, all the inspiration and motivation will be from Allah.
