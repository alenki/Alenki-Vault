	"I remember my mom when I was little she used to ask me did you do your homework? What did you read? I didn't go to school here I don't know, explain it to me. She would pretend that she doesn't know anything so I have the motivation to do my homework to explain to her and teach her stuff. Of course, she did it on purpose. She was the one teaching me." - Very interesting way of making your kid actually learn at school
