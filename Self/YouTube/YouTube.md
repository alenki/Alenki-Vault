Start reading books (and reviewing) with YouTube in mind. You can make a video on anything you come across that sounds interesting. Make a video on it, then make a short telling the idea in a short way, then promoting the video for more details. Do shorts, do YouTube!

Make the programming and all videos in general more funny and fun, try to come up with things that will keep the watcher entertained and feel humour

Video idea:
	Make a nostalgic gaming video for people in 2030 or something.
	Maybe make the first clip is the Devil May Cry 5 "I am the storm that is approaching"

Video idea:
	[https://youtube.com/shorts/1l9izM0J0bs?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/1l9izM0J0bs?feature=share)
	Make a video answering these stuff.

Make a video idea of Why cats DO walk on the Quran:
	Humans are required, or some say not, to make wudu before reading Quran. Now first of all, the sharia law doesn’t apply on cats. And second, cats, in islam, are said to be pure clean animals. So nor do cats not walk on the Quran, nor do they need to.

Video Idea:
	Explaining a basic code for a basic pong app

Video idea:
	I want this to play when I die. Determination. Undertale. Plus a nostalgic video for the duration of the song. The thumbnail maybe a skeleton on the ground dreaming about stampies lovely world

Video Idea:
	How I got a Brand new Logitech G432 Headset

Video Idea:
	1 year of boxing vs 5 years or whatever boxing (16vs17year old)
	Record a couple of rounds of us boxing, upload the raw version and also upload a version with your commentary on it

Video Idea:
	Motivational Youtubers
	Thumbnail: Hamza, Ad Rem, and others
	Basically talk about each one and how legendary they are
	Talk about Jan Ryczkowski and Andrew/Tristan Tate
	Talk about balkan gains.
	Matan is the most confusing guy as in making you confused in if he is joking or not.
	About the video idea of reviewing self improvement youtubers. Name: “self-improvement” Youtubers. When you look at the basic ones, you compare that to islam, or someone who is a Muslim. And show how it is easier there, how its lame to workout for the looks, and the muslim doesn't do that because he doesn't want 200 babes. Look at this vid before making it: [https://youtu.be/hIFBk9qjNY0](https://youtu.be/hIFBk9qjNY0)

	review the video, I've watched a ton of videos like this, but I just really really love this one. So much that I've made a video about it. It just gives you the pure raw actual no bs way to increase attention, the actual real way to better your brain and the exact thing everyone needs to do right now.

Video idea:
	Why is watching YouTube better than scrolling through social media. A lot of people have mentioned this before, while stopping mindless social media is a must, why is it sometimes good to watch YouTube? We don’t count YouTube shorts, while it is better than TikTok or any other type of short form content, it still really damages your attention span and focus among many other stuff. Then talk about the bad type of content, like memes, that are not mindlessly scrolling, but just mindlessly watching, while still damaging yourself. Also mention the Bill Wurtz video, how its very informative, but us a type of content that damages the attention span(although you still should watch it, its really good) , and your experience with it. Then talk about the good type of content like documentaries, or just people that specialize in something that you like, tutorials, guides, motivational, become great type videos. Mention some of your favourite YouTubers like The Math Sorcerer, the motivational guy with long hair that looks like an ancient greek, Hamza, and of course, Ad Rem.

Brilliant video idea: 
	What are the first steps of becoming great? First is to condition your mind for focus. If you just start reading books or studying ver hard subjects or focusing on hard tasks, even things such as sports, without conditioning your mind for it, then, you don’t have to fail at it, but you definitely aren't going to become great at it, master it. You will have a hard time through it and you won't make it that far. Talk about the things that condition your mind. Maybe even make a tutorial on how to condition your mind. Tall about your experience’s of reading books, but then stopping because your mind wasn't conditioned, then getting addicted to them because you actually got the ability to get emersed in them.

Video idea:
	Age does not matter.
	In our modern age of society 18 years old is the age where you start getting called an adult in most countries, which means that you have rights to drink, drive among other things. Also, these days in our community its called shameful if you are an adult and you still live with your parents. What the hell brow, you are 18 and YOU STILL LIVE WITH YOUR PARENTS????!!! Yeah. So does this mean that at 18 years old you're indeed mature and smart enough and got enough experiences to become free and do whatever you want? Well I think we all know that there are some people over 18 who aren't mature enough to have these rights and that there are people under 18 that SHOULD have these rights because they ARE mature enough. A 14 year-old can be more mature and smart than a 30 year old, and I think we all know that. But that's not the problem here. Especially not with the people making the rules, because these people don't have a way of figuring out at which age does each person become mature enough to have different rights, and they certainly can't give these right to all ages. So what do they do? They look at what they think to be the average age for being mature enough, which they found to be 18. Now I do agree that they chose the right age where the you get the minimum amount of young people that should have rights don't get them, and the minimum amount of old people that shouldn't have rights do get them. But in our day of age, where social media and other types of content is destroying the attention span, focus, concentration and tons of other things, I think that age should be moved up a little. But that's not the point here, the point is because of the internet. When people turn 18 years old, the fact that they start getting called adults makes them really bold and really turns up their ego. They, or at least most of them, think that now that they are "adults", they have freedom, and not only CAN they do all these stuff, but they should

	Do I have enough time?
	.
	Do I have enough time to try and become good at all the sports that seem so interesting to me? Bowling, basketball, all of martial arts, football, American football among many others.
	Do I have enough time to read all these books that I really really want to read?
	Do I have enough time to watch all these movies that I really want to watch?
	Do I have enough time to finish my 50 game backlog? And even spend tons of hours becoming really good at some?
	Do I have enough time to go to all these places I want to visit?
	And that's not even the main part, I count myself as a programmer, mathematician and physician. I am very interested in all aspects of Programming, math and physics. But sometimes I ask myself, will I really be able to learn and even master these things that just amaze me like Artificial Intelligence, Hacking, Software Engineering, Game Dev, Calculus and Vectors, Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Differential Geometry and even game theory, and of course, quantum physics.

Idea:
	Talk about the real side of growing on YouTube, and how all these videos don't actually think you can succeed, they are only using you for views and such, just like I am. The real truth, is that only the people that solve problems, or people that actually come up with genius ideas will grow their channel (The editing and such doesn't really matter that much). Note: Be 100% sure about what you say. Title: The truth behind growing on YouTube!

Idea:
	Full professional video about the life of Matvei Bronstein with photos from the book. Basically a retelling of the book about him. Title: How one of the best phisycists got killed by the Soviet Union for absolutely no reason!

Idea:
	A beginner getting pounded by the regional boxing champion. Guitar playing videos. How a school for smart people in Russia looks like. Chess tournament videos. To make interesting vids, meet people that will interest people and record it. Book reviews. School events that people might find interesting.

I came up with a genius idea:
	Let's make a 3 part video series about how to learn programming. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced. All of them are step by step, you tell them exactly what to do next, depending on the sirius courses. Basically steal their mind map. So beginner is the beginner sirius programming course, also maybe the stepik one, and you choose and tell them what you think is best to learn step-by-step and how to learn it: theory and problems. Intermediate is the algroithms course in sirius and others. Advanced is what Zalimbach prepared for the Regional VSOSH. His table for preparing. These 6 hour videos on youtube on things like dynamic programming and such. Codeforces edu and other stuff.
	Now, what to say in the beginning: I'm no number 1 in a competition or something, so why should you listen to this random 16 year old? Because I didn't create these mind maps. This is just a combined version of different preparing structures of the best programmers of Russia, like people over from Sirius, Stepik, and of course, my teacher. I'm only learning using these mind maps and they are working extremely effectively so I wanted to share them with you.
	I've seen a lot of tutorials about programming, and there are some really good ones. But no one tells you exactly what to do, what to learn next and how to learn it, so I came here to do exactly that!
	I've found books not effective for programming, because you somehow forget everything. Too much useless info, not enough and quality practice and blah blah blah.

Video idea: 
	How to become successful, how to start writing books.
