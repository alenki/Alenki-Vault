A plot is when you take the main character and just throw scenarios at him, put him in situations and how you make him handle it is the plot.

Readers enjoy being educated and entertained, but they never forget being emotionally mored.

Book idea:
	[[God or Science]]
	Miracles and contradictions of Islam, christianity and judaism.
	The science behind all religions. Questions and answers. Islam prediction of science matters. History. Experiences of people who converted to these religions. Miracles of the Quran when you read it, what happens to your life. Evidence that god exists and etc
	How did the Quran not change over time, how were the Hadiths written, how they act like history, but more reliable. Signs of judgement day (tall buildings, girls like boys, boys like girls, girls walk wearing stuff and naked)
	Maybe make it centered on the Quran, but you compare everything to the other books.
	A book that any scientist, priest, sheikh, whatever judaism has, and any person that wants to find the truth should read.

Idea:
	A world of christianity, everyone is christian, rules and laws based on christianity. There are groups of Devil worshippers, villages of cultists.
	There is a kind, strong, open-minded christian that experiences these cults and starts doing what Ibrahim (AS) did. After which he discovers the remnants of the Quran. Then he goes on to conquer the world with islam, fully believes of course, and teaches it to the people. He also has some miracle experiences which make him see the power of the Quran. Maybe finds remnants of the Hadiths along his way, that help him his journey.

Situation for a horror story:
	When he entered the room, what scared him wasn't the creepy Russian doll (make an interaction with the doll first, go d I hate dolls!), but the extremely ominous shadow figure behind it. (then he gets scared and blah blah blah)

Idea for a horror story:
	Guy gets attacked by a crow and takes that as a very bas sign, because after that he really fealt a bad atmosphere, so he returned home (make up a story about who he is and were he was heading)

Idea:
	I want to have a story with Attack on Titan like plot twists.

Idea:
	I want to write a novel that has a very cool character.

Idea:
	I want to write a guide to life (like the laws of powers or meditations and other stuff like that)

Idea:
	After I write a couple of books, I wanna teach people how to write books, either through a book or course, or youtube videos.
