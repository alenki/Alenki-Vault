Book idea:
	[[God or Science]]
	Miracles and contradictions of Islam, christianity and judaism.
	The science behind all religions. Questions and answers. Islam prediction of science matters. History. Experiences of people who converted to these religions. Miracles of the Quran when you read it, what happens to your life. Evidence that god exists and etc
	How did the Quran not change over time, how were the Hadiths written, how they act like history, but more reliable. Signs of judgement day (tall buildings, girls like boys, boys like girls, girls walk wearing stuff and naked)
	Maybe make it centered on the Quran, but you compare everything to the other books.
	A book that any scientist, priest, sheikh, whatever judaism has, and any person that wants to find the truth should read.


s:

The Bible, unfortunately, for Christians doesn't support their false beliefs. man has attributed his writing to God.That’s why we see these errors and contradictions, insertions and revisions.

To follow xtianity, you have to turn a blind eye to facts and not use logic. E.g 3 = 1. Or 100% man and 100% God. Or...hes God, but also son of God, etc

Prior to the alleged crucifiction, Jesus says his work is complete, John 17.4 another evidence that he wasn't here to die for sins. Later, he begs God to take the crucifiction away from him. Matt 27.46. If that was his whole mission, he wouldn't have said his mission was complete, nor would he beg to be saved.

It's a fact that Xmas and Easter celebrations are from satanic cults. Look it up. It's no coincidence that a religion that makes people worship Gods creation instead of him has celebrations derived from satanic cults.

Every prophet before Jesus, and Jesus and his disciples, and every prophet after, worshipped God as 1 person. Never a trinity. only worshipped the father

I haven't misrepresented what your scripture says.

No matter how hard Satan has tried to corrupt it through trinitarian scribes, it's still easily dissected to show that what the church and Paul taught you ain't from Jesus.

Thats why you only have ambiguous verses, such as me and the father are one ( disciples also one in same way further in same verse ), before Abraham was..mistranslation...even then how is that saying Jesus is God??? If you see me you've seen the father...another verse  Paul followers say is proof Jesus is God...but wait a minute, if that is literal, than that means Jesus is the Father..and that is not the xtian belief. They are 2 separate entities. It's obviously metaphoric if you read the context instead of cherry-picking. Besides, the Bible says no man can see God and live.

Jesus was given authority and glory...GIVEN...God is authority. Again, how at all does this show Jesus is God? Also, Jesus says he gives this very glory to the believers.

Every verse you use as evidence Jesus is God is a desperate reach, its easily debunked by the bible itself. Just mistranslstions, and interpolation and fraud.

why turn a blind eye to the clear-cut unambiguous statements of Jesus proving he is not God. It defies belief. E.g  I was sent only for the lost sheep of Israel, that they may know you, THE ONLY TRUE GOD.. John 17.3 and Jesus Christ whom you sent. I go to my father AND YOUR FATHER, my God and your God... John 20.17. Jesus is a mediator between God and man. The list is endless. See other comments.

You would expect trinitarianism to be all over the bible. If this was the most important message, for our salvation, why is it not there in the NT? You have one interpolation about Trinity but not in manuscripts and a confirmed interpolation and so removed by most Bibles.

Then you turn to Paul's statements, a man who never met Jesus and preached opposite what Jesus preached!! Still, you remain ignorant? That is why you're considered followers of Paul and not Jesus.

Then you say look at the prophesies in the OT. When we look at these prophesies we find again, verses have been changed and mistranslated to inject your falsehood. And even then, it falls apart under the smallest scrutiny. E.g. Isaiah 53.5, which is about the babylonian exile of joos, trinitarians have changed it to make out its Jesus, FACTS, ask the Jews about this verse from their book.

Isaiah 9.6. The Hebrew verbs are in past tense, but again, satanic trinitarians have changed it to future tense. Then it says he will be called eternal father. Jesus is never called the father, and it is totally against their Creed that Jesus was the father. They are supposed to be separate beings, who form 1. Jesus is never referred to as the father, yet Paul followers are happy to accept this verse as a prophesy about Jesus.

Then you got Isaiah 7.14, again mischievous trinitarians have mistraslated the verse to imply the virgin birth of christ. The Hebrew says "amah," meaning a young woman, but the Greek has been changed to translate as a virgin. Smh

Despite the clear evidence of this falsehood, Paul followers will deny it.

Sadly, one needs to remain insincere and throw logic out the window to remain on this falsehood.

Sorry if this offends. Please do study, this is your salvation. Stop blaspheming our Almighty God

s:

I and my father are one. John 10.30....that they may all be one, just as you, father are in me, and I in you, that they may also be in us....The glory that you have given me, I have given to them, that they may be one, even as we are one. John 17:20

So are the disciples also God? Because they are one with Jesus and God just as Jesus and God are one? Obviously not. So John 10.30 is not a literal one, but a metaphorical one. When cherry picking goes wrong. Thats why you should read the bible, and not believe whatever church or people have taught you.

Whoever has seen me has seen the father. John 14.9. You take it literally and use this as evidence Jesus is God. So that would literally mean Jesus is the Father! In the Christian Creed, is Jesus ever the father? NO. They are 2 separate entities. Jesus is not the father, and the father is not Jesus. So again, you cherry pick a metaphorical statement and claim its literal, but if you think it through you would realise the blunder. If it wasn't cherry picked and it was understood with context, and other verses in the Bible were read, you would see many verses along these lines, that are not literal but metaphorical. Besides, the Bible says no man can see God and live.

Every prophet that came was the only way to God during their respective prophet hood. When Abraham had his time, the way to God was only through his teaching, when Moses was here, it was through him, likewise Jesus, likewise Muhammad. He is the last prophet bringing the final revelation from God, and our only way to God is now through his teachings.

Before Abraham was, I am. First of all, its a mistranslation. But before we get to that, how is this saying he is God? Being before Abraham makes him God? If you had read and understood the context, you would have realised it was talking about God's foreknowledge. It is saying that the mission of Jesus was predestined before Abraham was on earth. Likewise Muhammad says that he was a prophet when Adam was between water and clay. We don't take that as evidence Muhammad was God! He was a man and prophet of God.

The statement 'I am' is in many places in the Bible, the exact words as the above, but its translated as 'I am he', Paul says it, blind man says it, but only in John 8:48 its translated as "I am" copying the translation of the "I am" that was used from OT about the Almighty God.

Instead of depending on mistranslation, ambiguous statements, interpolation and fraud, look at the clear cut unambiguous statements from Jesus, like John 17.3, where Jesus says the ONLY TRUE GOD IS THE FATHER, or John 20:17 where he tells us we have the same father as him, the same God as him.

Please reflect and study the bible properly. Better yet, read a red letter bible, where the statements of Jesus are in red. See what Jesus says, and not what others have said, and if you are sincere, it will rock your world. Sincerely as the God of Jesus to guide you

S:

Muslims say Jesus is a prophet and messiah. What do those close to Jesus say?

If this man was divine, he would never have been called a prophet.

Matthew 21:11

And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth in Galilee.”

Luke 7:16

Fear gripped them all, and they began glorifying God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited His people!”

John 4:19

The woman *said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.

Matthew 21:46

When they sought to seize Him, they feared the people, because they considered Him to be a prophet.

John 6:14

Therefore when the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”

John 7:40

Some of the people therefore, when they heard these words, were saying, “This certainly is the Prophet.”

John 9:17

So they *said to the blind man again, “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.”

Luke 24:19

And He said to them, “What things?” And they said to Him, “The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people,

Mark 6:15

But others were saying, “He is Elijah.” And others were saying, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”

Mark 8:28

They told Him, saying, “John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.”

Luke 9:8

and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen again.

OK, so Jesus doesnt refute anybody calling him a Prophet, he reaffirms it

Luke 13:33 . . . . I must proceed on my way. For it wouldn’t do for a prophet of God to be killed except in Jerusalem.

Mark 6:3-4 Then they scoffed . . . . They were deeply offended and refused to believe in him. Then Jesus told them, “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives and his own family”.

In the above two verses, Jesus called himself a prophet. There are also many verses indicating that during his lifetime on earth the people in Judea and Galilee regarded him as a prophet.

Regarding the verses in which Jesus says that he is the messiah or equal to God (mainly in the Gospel of John) most scholars believe that Jesus never said that. It was what people started saying about him after his death and put on his lips in the Gospels written at least 4 decades later.,.\,.\,\.....

Embryology In Surah Al-Mu’minun, Allah (SWT) says “We created man from an extract of clay. Then We made him as a drop in a place of settlement, firmly fixed. Then We made the drop into an alaqah (leech, suspended thing, and blood clot), then We made the alaqah into a mudghah (chewed substance)…” (Quran 23:12-14).

Science has only proved this with the help of the latest technology. It is Professor Emeritus Keith L. Moore who is one of the world’s most well-known scientists in the fields of anatomy and embryology, who said that “It is clear to me that these statements must have come to Muhammad from God, because almost all of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later” [6].

1. The Sky’s Protection In Surah Al-Anbya, Allah (SWT) says: “And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away” (Quran 21:32). It is a scientific fact that the sky, with all of its gasses, protects the earth and life that is present on it from the harmful rays of the sun. If there was no protective layer, life on earth would cease to exist as the temperature on earth would be freezing at -270.556°C, the same as the temperature in space.
2. Iron within Meteorites In Surah Al-Hadid it is written that: “We sent down Iron with its great inherent strength and its many benefits for humankind” (Quran 57:25). According to M. E. Walrath, iron is not natural to the earth. Scientists state that billions of years ago, the earth was struck by meteorites. It was within these meteorites that iron was present and due to explosion on earth, we now have iron available to us [7]. The Quran, as stated above, has already enlightened us of this fact by stating “We sent down iron with its great inherent strength…”.
3. The Meeting of the Seas In Surah Ar-Rahman, it states “He released the two seas, meeting [side by side], Between them is a barrier [so] neither of them transgresses” (Quran, 55:19-20). Science has discovered that in places where two different seas meet, there is a barrier that divides them which helps both the seas maintain their own temperature, salinity, as well as density [8].

ADVERTISE ON TMV

1. Sun Moving in Orbit In Surah Al-Anbya, it states “And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming” (Quran, 21:33). Although it was only a widespread belief in the 20th century amongst the astronomers, today it is a well-established fact that the Sun, the Moon, and all the other bodies in the Universe are moving in an orbit and constantly moving, not stationary [9] as commonly thought before.
2. Mountains as Stakes In Surah An-Naba, Allah (SWT) states: “Have We not made the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes?” (Quran, 78:6-7). In a book by geophysicist Frank Press called ‘Earth’ (1986), he explains how the mountains are like stakes and are buried deep within the earth’s surface [10]. Mt. Everest which has a height of approximately 9 km above sea level has a root deeper than 125 km – thus only reinforcing the Quranic revelation of the importance and strength of mountains on our earth.
3. Expansion of the Universe In Surah Adh-Dhariyat, Allah (SWT) says “And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander” (Quran, 51:47). According to the prominent physicist Stephen Hawking in his book ‘A Brief History of Time’, “The discovery that the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century” [11], although centuries before the Quran had already revealed to us that in regards to the universe, “We are its expander”.
4. Pain Receptors In Surah An-Nisa, it is stated that “We shall send those who reject our revelations to the (hell) fire. When their skins have been burned away, We shall replace them with new ones so that they may continue to feel the pain: God is almighty, all-wise” (Quran, 4:56).

For a long time it was thought that the sense of feeling and pain was dependent on the brain. However, it has been discovered that there are pain receptors present in the skin. Without these pain receptors, a person would not be able to feel pain [12] – another example of the scientific miracles of the Holy Quran.

1. Internal Waves in the Oceans In Surah An-Nur, Allah (SWT) has revealed: “Or [they are] like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves, upon which are waves, over which are clouds – darknesses, some of them upon others. When one puts out his hand [therein], he can hardly see it. And he to whom Allah has not granted light – for him there is no light” (Quran, 24:40).

Incredibly, oceanographers have stated that unlike the belief that waves only occur on the surface, there are waves that take place internally in the oceans, below the surface of the water. Invisible to the human eye, these can only be detected through special equipment [13].

1. Frontal Lobe In Surah Al-Alaq, in the story of a man named Abu Jahl who was a cruel oppressive tribal leader in the times of the Prophet Mohammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Allah revealed a verse to warn him. Therein Allah (SWT) says: “No indeed! if he does not stop, We will seize him by the forehead, his lying, sinful forehead” (Quran, 96:15-16).

According to a book titled ‘Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology,’ it is clearly stated that the forehead or frontal area of the brain is responsible for motivation and the foresight to plan and initiate movements. All this takes place in the prefrontal area of the brain. The part of the brain that is responsible for movement and planning is said to be seized if he does not stop. Other studies have proved that it is this prefrontal region that is responsible for the function of lying [14].

Another study at the University of Pennsylvania in which volunteers were questioned during a computerized interrogation showed that the volunteers who were lying had increased activity in their prefrontal and premotor cortices [15]. Subhanallah, there is a deeper meaning behind why the Quran stated: “We will seize him by the forehead”.

The most important thing to remember is that the conception of knowledge (Al-Ilm) in Islam is the Guiding Light (Huda) separating right from wrong (Al furqan). Therefore, in the same way the sun brings light to our eyes to see the world around us, Al-Ilm is the source of guidance to see the signs of Allah (SWT) around us. More such facts that are already mentioned in the Quran and will be proven in the future by mankind as Allah (SWT) says in the Quran in Surah Ar-Rahman, “So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?”
