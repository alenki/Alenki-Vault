#Self 



Idea for Arthur:
	He sees the magazine and a new AI released, for example, everyone who pays can get fully diagnosed for all possible health problems he could have. And do something with this.

Idea:
	You can continue the current story about him starting to find out the truth, then show how he begins training and then skip 2 years and talk about how he progressed, then the main story happens after. Well, the main story IS his life basically.

Idea:
	Giving the novel VSauce vibes would serve well. Like every time he finds that he does something bad, he asks, why? Why is it bad? Why is it bad that I like being in charge? Maybe he asks god for him to become what he was supposed to be, and God starts making him question everything he does.

Idea:
	Internet has to be destroyed, this corruption has to be eliminated, Arthur will be the one to destroy it.

Idea:
	Конец романа: он сломал интернет, а дальше идëт мир без интернета. Этот мир и его путешествия там это книга номер 2, или том 2

Situation:
	He got so crazy, angry, focused or whatever, that he started getting an aura of bent space-time around him. He started bending the world. Explainable by the world being a video played in your mind, that can be manipulated depending on how you imagine it.

Сценарий:
	Но Артур не особо выделял им внимание, потому-что всë что говорят эти религиозные бабушки и дедушки это, как все знают, бред какой-то, даже? Ну их никто не слушает, мир на автоматизме их игнорирует, поэтому и я должен их игнорировать и не слушать, даже? Стоп. Отмена. Переворачиваемся и пересматриваем второй раз. Почему? Почему же их нельзя слушать? Потому-что они старые? Потому-что они тупые? А может всë таки есть причина того, что в обществе общепринято не слушать их? Может они так специально сделали чтобы что-то спрятать?

Idea:
	Из контроля выйти очень сложно, но возможно. Единственное что надо сделать, это сделать первый шаг вперëд, а дальше человек сам поймëт что надо делать. Артур сделал первый шаг, убрал всë плохое, и начал медитировать и собирать хорошие привычки

Idea:
	Make a character that is so iconic, fanfics will be made about him. Anime's and movies. He will become a well known legend. Make him that powerful. He will be a character that is a master of all. He will start from 0, but gain focus, commitment, will, positive ego, faith of god. All of his powers are from god, make it islamic. He will fall to pleasures at the beginning, but will become a master of them by the end. It will start non-fictional, but then he will become so powerful he will start doing things like imagining things coming true, and them actually coming true

Idea:
	Okay, start writing a random story, anything. Let's start off with a character that wants to have elements of Stoicism, wants to be perfect and such, maybe introduce angels and demons and invisible walls between them, the character breaking the 4th wall (4th dimension) and it being a real theory of a dimension. Make it include real actual physics with that approach, if you choose it. Write in Russian to make your knowledge of this language better. Introduce a character as fast as you can. The start is where you grab the attention of people. He was a warrior that looked for the secrets of the world. You can make it so he basically thought of that because of different reasons, and you're gonna describe these reasons and his emotions while experiencing them. Like oh, why is the sky so blue and such and such. He found them (the secrets of life, includes maybe a theory of some sorts) and had power to control the fabric of space-time. Also, he met a strong woman with great power (non-fictional) of her own(optional, could do with no love)

Idea:
	Make the main character change with time, have a special type of ego and such, and make him change with time. Maybe make a character that's better than him at the start but doesn't have that psychologic power. Make their ego, psychology and way of thinking have meaning.


Idea:
	Focus, commitment, adaptability, using his mistakes and failures for learning something new, will, islamic principles which can make use of other aspects in a non-toxic healthy way, John Wick, Stoicism - all in one character.
