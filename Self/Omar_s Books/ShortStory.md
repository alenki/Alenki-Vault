You have to write at least one short story before writing a novel. Start off with short stories, a novel has to be the destination, not the beginning.

Short story idea:
	Guy sees a demon, he feels numbness and something, then as he looks at the time, in the reflection of his watch he sees himself very old, with grey hair, which happened because of what he saw, his body couldn't терпеть

Horror idea:
	Similar to to The Tell-Tale Heart, but instead of the eye of the old man, its an eye of that main door, the eye that haunts him during his sleep. Describe an incredible scare event of him waking up in his small house and looking at it while it looks at him menacingly.

Idea:
	'K' and her interactions with her father and how meeting a human has changed her perspective. A story about her meeting that person and finding out he also has problems.

Idea for a short story:
	Allah said that people will start believing when the sun rises from the west, but their acceptance won't be accepted. Make a story about that. What happened after the sun has risen from the west. Even could be used in Arthurs Novel.
