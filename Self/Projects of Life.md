make a Sorting Visualizer and a Fractal Generator

Right now I'm starting YouTube, because I see that as an incredibly good business that you can use for getting yourself out there, and for beginning your money  gathering journey, and also for learning materials better, by explaining it to your audience! [[YouTube]]

Project idea after making YouTube programming guides:
	After these videos, create actual courses, maybe even just Sirius and Stepik translated to english. Stolen problems and videos that link to YouTube videos that I created, translated from the Russian ones. About that, there are really a lot of uncovered topics like Bin-Search by answer or the Bin-Search with the crazy doubles. So I could really create some new stuff!

These are the main projects that I want to do in life, to gain money and popularity and to improve myself.

I wanna make youtube videos to get myself out there, have people to read my stories when I write them, gain popularity and possibly gain money. Become known so I could prepare for the upcoming world.
I also want to write novels and short stories and show them on youtube and learn using them. Possibly another type of income.
