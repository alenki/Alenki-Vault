#Programming 

Alright lets do this, so first of all I should try and upload this jorney to YT so we can maybe get a headstart when publishing a game.

Idea #1:
	Create a small simple map with some fighting platforms, implement a combat system, implement AI and see where it goes from there

Idea #2:
	Get some post-processing, implement animated backgrounds and make the game look as good as possible.

Idea #3:
	Start off with just a bow and an arrow system, then start doing other stuff like the AI and gamemode. After you finish everything you can go back to the game and give it updates (new weapons, maps, characters)

Reminder #1:
	Make a good Reddit and Twitter page, bookmark the game jam website, check the UE4 for cool and cheap assets.

Tip:
	Just chillax, don't rush anything, you still have a lot of time. Get motivated and stay in the business.

Tip:
	Menu, title screen, pause menu music idea is the combination of the guitar chords: E minor, A minor, C, E.

Tip:
	Get ideas from games. Example: Dead Cells, Hollow Knight, Terraria.
