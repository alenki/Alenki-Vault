#Programming 

The game should be veery basic for a first proper game, probably low-poly to learn blender or half-life like graphics. Basic horror game with either 1 hour story or endless game or something that sort. I would really like it to be inspired by Undertale.


Ideas:

NOTE:
These are just ideas, they don't have to be implemented. Just ideas.

-You could make a mechanic where upon interaction with something you could start a sort of 2d game battles, like the battles in undertale

-When you are chased start undertale-like ultra stressful music that really gets you stressed

-Maybe make it a small story with very weird undertale-like dialogues (the really fun ones, unique). And in the end, when the monster catches you, you could have a dialouge where it says: 
You: "..."
End boss: "Well this is awkward..."
End boss: "Sorry"

-Maybe the horror game could have undertale like dialogues (comedic and sarcastic dialogoues)

-Just make it a first person Undertale, doesnt necceserally have to be horror, I just really want to make something like Undertale. Really want to make smart references to the end game, smart and extremely funny dialogues like in Undertale.
