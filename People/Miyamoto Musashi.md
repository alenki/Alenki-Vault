Miyamoto Musashi - Greatest swords man of Japan. Won 60 fights and never lost any.

Miyamoto knew that greatness had a price, and he needed to pay it, no matter how expensive it was. He sacrificed typical desires and the path of comfort.
In the modern world, instant pleasure has never been more easily accessible.
Pleasure is one of the most valuable currencies. You're almost never out of its sight. This toxic pleasure doesn't lead to happiness, it only leads to emptiness and addiction.
Time well spent is when you do something that matters, and that feeling has no equal. Indulging in pleasure steals time from us.
Doing what matters will always be the true source of happiness.
Next time you go to scroll on your phone to get that short quick dopamine. Think about how it compares to the feeling you get when having a nice body, your business gaining money, you winning a championship.

Stay focused:
	"Never stray from the way" - Miyamoto Musashi

Note: Read The Dokkodo and check The Bushido. (Both written by Miyamoto Musashi)

Miyamoto was a man of almost surreal amounts of self-control, determination and discipline. He was born in a pretty rich family, yet he left to explore at a very young age. Even when he was invited to the most fancy places, he always stayed for a little bit, then went back on his journey.
He could've stayed and lived a comfortable life, ate fancy food, but he chose they way. 
Luxury and pleasure didn't dictate his actions.

Is the flow state just a state of completely blocking out the Shaiateen?
