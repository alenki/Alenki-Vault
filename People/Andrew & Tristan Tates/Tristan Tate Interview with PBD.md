Tristan Tate Interview with PBD after jail time.

When his father saw him and Andrew fight, he made them stay in a box and just look at each other for hours on end. There they learned, that there is no outcome to fighting. It's really useless, nothing will come out of it.

He had a friend that was driving a Ferrari. They asked him how he got it as a lawyer and he said:
	You white people have 5 different kids in the family that all live at different places and pay different rents, eat different food, live different lives. I have 3 brothers: an engineer, a doctor and one that owns a construction company and we live at the same house and all have the tools we need to flourish. We live in the same house, our wives help each other make us food and each time there's a new kid, we just expand the house because one of us owns a construction company. Like this we've saved some money and got ourselves a couple of Toyota's , a Ferrari and a Rolls-Royce, that we each drive.
