I can use this to right notes for the Russian Final exam, where I can make notes with theory and exercises for each of the exam tasks.
I could also use it for literature FOR the exam, where I can note moments that I think will be needed for the exam.

While reading books I could use a sticky note to note moments I want to remember, moments that could help me, or moments where I had thoughts that I don't want to forget. And after finishing the book I could go from the begging and write here everything that I would like to keep from the sticky notes.

In my everyday life I can right notes, important thoughts that I dont want to forget on a notebook, and then after a while I can read everything from the notebook and write important stuff to obsidian (like shower thoughts).

Also could be used for Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science etc.
