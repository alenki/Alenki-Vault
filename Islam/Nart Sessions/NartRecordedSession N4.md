The Prayers and Quran before anything.

This was a very long one so I will just write down the information that I want to use in practice.

First of all, the way he has analyzed it, there are a lot of thoughts that come into your mind that exactly describe what Shaitaan is trying to tell you. For example, at night you start to lose sight of your goals and you start to want to do the easy thing and just become a normal person and play games and watch movies and such. Shaitaan really makes these things that are bad for you look so good and relaxing.

40 days principle. If you hold on to something, routine for example, for 40 days, it will become easy for you. If you try to do something every day for 40 days, then you WILL no matter what, have problems in doing so. Problems will come up to prevent you from doing it, thoughts, laziness and such. At exactly the 6 day mark for some reason you are most likely to stop. If you do stop, realise it at the 7th day and try it again, until you reach 40 days, because after that it should become easy.

Salat is the most important thing, try to keep it consistent. Try to do it at the exact times constantly for 40 days so it could become routine. 
After that, The Quran is the most valuable piece of data available currently and forever in the world. Allah said that there's a little bit of everything in the Quran. EVERYTHING. And for each letter you read from the Quran, you get 10 hasanats even if you don't understand what you are reading. The more you read and finish Quran the more you understand it more and more, and so does your life change more and more. The more you read and memorise the Quran, the more you will go higher on the leaderboard, the more stronger Angels will come to help you and more stronger demons come to destroy you.

To become higher and better after doing salat and reading Quran, you have to start doing the extra things, like saying stuff for 100 times a day on a routine, after salat and etc. Do sunna, Muhammad said to do what he did, pray like he did. So you pray more like he did, do things that he did, read the Quran like he did, be like him.

Times where what the angels have written about your actions goes to Allah and gets closed off is at Maghrib and Fajr daily, the first hour after Maghrib always is very bad, because Shaitaan is at his strongest, this is why parents tell their kids to be home before Maghrib. For weekly it's at thursdays. For monthly it is at Ramadan
Wednesday is the worst day of the week, it's where a lot of bad things happen, you feel bad, people are drunk and etc. I don't know why.

[7/8, 19:45] Nart: ربي زدني علما هاد من القران اللهم اني اعوذ بك من علم لا ينفع هاد من كتب السنة
اللهم إني أعوذ بك من علم لا ينفع، ومن قلب لا يخشع، ومن نفس لا تشبع، ومن دعوة لا يستجاب لها.
