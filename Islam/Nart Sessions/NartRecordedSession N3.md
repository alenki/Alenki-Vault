There is a guy he knows that said that he wanted to go to china to find himself which really fascinated him, finding yourself meaning just sit, delete all thoughts and just be yourself.

God said that for everything you leave for the sake god, you will be provided with something better than it. Once Nart took a whole year where he played no video games watched no tv and bought these Nokia phones so he could call. Then he started seeing some things, when you go out, you even start looking at different people, understand them and understand their character just by their expressions and looks.

For everything we provide a pair - Said Allah. Nart said there are two meanings, either it's a boy and girl, or it's the Newtons Third Law, which is every force has an equal and opposite force. So if there is FreeMasons and people that control the world, there are people of equal power that do the same thing but on the good side. There is the true path and there is the wrong path. Now I asked before this how he gets his information, he said this is where he started from, but didn't have the time to finish telling me before we went to something different on accident.
