#Islam 

I have a theory, that I won't find out the secret of the world or something cool like that, until I've memorized the whole Quran.


About the sun rising from the west:
	Around 700,000 years ago the poles shifted. So if you used a compass back then, what usually was east was now west, and vice versa. Scientists said, that the next time this could have could be in less than 1000 years. 1400 years ago they didnâ€™t know the poles could shift.
