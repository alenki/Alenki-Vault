Itâ€™s said, that you shouldn't trust too much, people that are not with Allah. You have to be respectful but never let them too close. Omar ibn Alkhattab, when he was taking important decisions, he only let people who have memorized the whole Quran into the room, then started congressing. People that are not with Allah have given the remote to shaitan, so they will only do you bad.
