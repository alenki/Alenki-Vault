# Science is always changing. Islam never changes.

Back in the days scientists used to believe that the universe has always existed. Islam says it has a beginning (God made it in 6 days), which makes it "evidence" that Islam is wrong. Now that we have more data, we say that the universe does have a beginning which is the Big-Bang. The soviets really didn't like the idea because it made religion look right. 
Science always changes. If all of your life you saw white swans, you will have a theory that all swans are white, until you see a black swan for the first time in your life.

I have a theory, that I won't find out the secret of the world or something cool like that, until I've memorized the whole Quran.


About the sun rising from the west:
	Around 700,000 years ago the poles shifted. So if you used a compass back then, what usually was east was now west, and vice versa. Scientists said, that the next time this could have could be in less than 1000 years. 1400 years ago they didnâ€™t know the poles could shift.
