Erwin Schr√∂dinger

Schrodinger's Cat is an experiment about [[Quantum Theory]]. [[Superposition]].

In this experiment there is a cat in the box, with a radiation device that has a 50% chance to kill the cat. We won't know if the cat is dead or alive until we open the box. 
Using the [[Superposition]] principle of a particle. While the box is closed off, the cat is both dead and alive at the same time. Only when we open the box, the superposition of the cat collapses and it chooses a state to be in.
