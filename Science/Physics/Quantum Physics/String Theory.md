When adding gravity to [[Quantum Physics]], all the mathematics break down. So if we could marry gravity to quantum physics and [[The Standart Model]], we could have the [[Theory of Everything]].
GRAVITY + STANDART MODEL = THEORY OF EVERYTHING.

So, very smart people cam up with a new story. They asked: What is more complex than a point? A line. Or a string. String theory was born.

What makes string theory so elegant, is that it describes many different elementary particles as different modes of vibration of the string.

String theory resonated with gravity, it brought a lot of ~~hope~~ and excitement. String theory quickly graduated to be a possible [[Theory of Everything]].

**BUT.**
Much of the maths involving a consistent string theory does not work in our universe with its three spatial and one temporal dimensions.
String theory requires *10 dimensions* to work out. So, string theorists did calculations in model universes. Then they tried to get rid of the additional 6 dimensions and describe our own universe. But so far, nobody has succeeded. And no prediction of string theory has been proven in an experiment.

Even if string theory hasnt been proven, we could still use it to try to answer some questions about quantum gravity that have been puzzling physiscists for decades, such as how black holes work.
