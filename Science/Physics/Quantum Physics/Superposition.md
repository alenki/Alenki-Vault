Until a particle is measured and observed, it actually exists in all the states it could possibly be in simultaneously. If a particle can be in one state, and in another, and in another, then it will be in all these states simultaneously. This is called being in a superposition. When you start to observe the particle, it will choose a fixed state to be in and that's what you will see.
