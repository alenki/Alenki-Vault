Random guy in the youtube comments (@iammatthew4797):
	"I actually have a theory regarding quantum tunneling and dark energy's: What's outside of our universe is no different than what we call a vacuum within. Like a blowing bubble, you can make the bubble as big as you want by adding mere air, but the air is no different than the air outside of the bubble, there's just a confined space. Imagine if the universe is just a bubble in the void that has allowed particles to come within reach of each other to create objects like stars and such, just like a bubble, adding more of what's outside of our universe, and through quantum tunneling makes its way into our universe without breaking the seal, and since the universe is big, there's a lot of dark energy that can seep in and as the universe gets bigger, there will be more and more opportunities for dark energy to quantum tunnel in. This creates the exponential growth."
