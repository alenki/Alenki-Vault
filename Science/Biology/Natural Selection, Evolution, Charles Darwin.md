If you read his book, Charles Darwin himself says that there are missing links, he says that he got no 100% proof, but it's a theory, the most likely one. It's just a theory, not a fact. (Evolution) There is no 100% that we evolved from apes, it's just an assumption.

>"If you say evolution occurs by natural selection, it looks scientific compared with saying God created everything. Now they say natural selection created everything, but they don't explain how."
