When there is low atmospheric pressure above the ocean. Warm moist air goes up and cold air gets warmer and creates gaps along the way, and cold air from all around and from very long distances rushes in to fill in the gaps All of that air then goes in to a spiral and starts spinning instead of filling in the gaps. All of the air that comes in joins the rotating spiral and there goes the cyclone. Cyclone is a general term used to describe any rotating, organised cloud that originates over water. Cyclones, Hurricanes and Typhoons are the same event but different names for different locations.

Hurricane: Atlantic and Northeast Pacific.
Typhoon: Northwest Pacific.
Cyclone: South Pacific, Indian Ocean.

Cyclones are clockwise.
Hurricanes are counterclockwise.
Tropical Cyclones range from 100km to 2000km in diameter. 
They can grow up to a height of 10km and they last 3-7 days.
