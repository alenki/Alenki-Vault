The Golden Ratio

PHI = 1,618033988749895


I just found out that visualizing everything here will be impossible, reference to the black notebook that I've written about it in.

The Da Vinci Code:
	"The number PHI, 1.618, is considered a very important number in art. PHI is generally considered the most beautiful number in the universe."
	Examples in nature:
		- If you divide the number of female bees by the number of male bees in any beehive in the world, you always get the same number... 1.618.
		- The ration of each nautilus spirals diameter to the next is 1.618.
		- Da Vinci actually exhumed corpses to measure the exact proportions of human bone structure. He was the first to show that the human body is literally made of building blocks whose proportional values always equal PHI
		- Measure the distance from the tip of your head to the floor. The divide that by the distance from your belly to the floor = PHI
		- Measure the distance from your shoulder to your fingertips and then divide it by the distance from your elbow to the fingertips. PHI.
		- Hip to floor, by knee to floor. PHI. Finger joints, toes, spinal divisions, all equal to PHI
		- Greek Parthenon, the pyramids of Egypt, United Nations building in New York, Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Also PHI
