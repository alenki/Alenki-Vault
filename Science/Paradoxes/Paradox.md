Paradox:
	If me and Alex stood next to each other. Our atoms started swapping one by one. At what point will I become Alex and Alex will become me?

Paradox:
	Let's say you have a time limit, infinite lemon's and an infinitely big bucket, that can fit anything. The time starts, and each time it reaches the middle point from the last time, a lemon is dropped in to the bucket. After the time finishes, how many lemons are there in the bucket?
	Time (n) = 10s. M = lemons.
	5s M++
	2.5s M++
	1.25s M++  ...  to infinity
